# 🖼️ Image Denoising using Spatial Filters in MATLAB

This project demonstrates various **spatial filtering techniques** in MATLAB to remove **Salt & Pepper noise** from grayscale images. It showcases the implementation and comparison of Median, Min, Max, Midpoint, and Alpha-Trimmed Mean filters.

## 🔧 Features
- GUI for image selection
- Salt & Pepper noise addition
- Noise reduction using five filtering techniques
- Visual comparison using subplot displays
- Saves all filtered images to the original directory

## 🧪 Filters Implemented
1. **Median Filter**  
2. **Min Filter**  
3. **Max Filter**  
4. **Midpoint Filter**  
5. **Alpha-Trimmed Mean Filter**
